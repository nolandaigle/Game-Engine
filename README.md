# Game-Engine
Game Engine for me and my friends to use. It is written in C++/SFML, all the game scripting is done in lua.

It is not very well commented, and a lot of it is hacked together from different projects, so I would not reccommend using this code as an example or anything like that.

You are totally welcome to steal anything you want from it.

Thanks!!!!
